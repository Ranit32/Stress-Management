# Stress-Management
Build a Stress management system using python which track the stress of a student.

Student Stress Analysis - README

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing student stress levels using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model training using various classifiers.

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Use

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Ranit_student_stress.ipynb

Run each cell sequentially to load the dataset, process it, visualize data trends, and train machine learning models.

Evaluate the performance of different models and interpret the results.

Features

Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Outlier detection using Isolation Forest

Data preprocessing using RobustScaler

Model training using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Stacking Classifier
